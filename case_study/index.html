      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>&quot;Home Chef&quot; is as web application dynamically built on PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS with just a touch of
        JavaScript. I encountered several challenges throughout the project, but along the way was a lot of discovery as
        to just how powerful and useful PHP can be especially when backed with a MySQL database.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="challenge">
      <h2>Project Challenge</h2>
      <p>Students will create a custom web application. The topic will be an online cookbook featuring a library of
        recipes.</p>
      <p>Students will be provided with a library of pre-written recipes in PDF format, as well as a group of images
        related to each recipe. Each student will create their own branded web application that will display the recipes
        and provide a user interface for browsing, searching and filtering through all of the available content.</p>
      <p>The application must use the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>MySQL</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="process">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <div id="sub-data" class="sub-section">
        <h3>The Data</h3>
        <p>&quot;Home Chef&quot; is all about the data. From its conception, the project focused on how to most
          effectively layout the data in a way that could be applicable to an infinite number of recipes. Currently, the
          site is built around forty recipes, but could theoretically be expanded with relative ease.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="sub-dev" class="sub-section">
        <h3>The Development</h3>
        <p>Initially constructing the templates in pure HTML allowed for a more rapid development of the skeleton, as it
          was easier for rapid adjustments that needed to be made. It allowed me to see where my initial sketches fell
          flat in supporting the data. What I quickly ran into was an issue of balancing images with data, focusing on
          one over the other would make the entire interface feel incredibly awkward.</p>
        <img class="sketch" src="img/sketch01.jpg" alt="Initial sketches"><img class="sketch" src="img/sketch02.jpg"
          alt="Initial sketches">
        <p>Working with this caused me to slim down my initial container ideas and remove the subtitles and recipe
          descriptions and increase the size of the link buttons. Which makes sense, as on a mobile device the links
          were not only too small, but were pushed so far down by the excess content that there was a visual disconnect
          between the image of the meal and the link to start cooking it.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="sub-dev_chall" class="sub-section">
        <h3>Development Challenges</h3>
        <p>The largest hurdle to overcome was initializing the MySQL database. Gathering the data was no issue, and
          conceptually it was easy to plan out how to use that data, it was that middle step that became a challenge. I
          worked closely with Brianna Buissereth to build the MySQL database which took the better part of seven weeks
          to perfect. However, once the database was live it was incredible to see our hard work pay off, and with it
          fully functional the rest of the development went rather smoothly.</p>
        <p>The only other issue to crop up showed me the absolute importance to iterate a while loop. On the recipe page
          not only did the six steps for the recipe magically appear, but so did about four hundred duplicates in waves
          upon waves that brought FireFox to a grinding halt. Needless to say, i++.</p>

    <section id="results">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>While prior to this project I was aware of the capabilities of PHP, the practicality of it had eluded me.
        Getting the back end database up and running may be a bit tedious, but the core of the language I now see as
        almost irreplaceable. Any projects larger than just a couple pages seems almost a waste to use pure HTML even
        just for the sake of having a global header and footer structure.</p>
      <div id="sub-future" class="sub-section">
        <h3>Future Development</h3>
        <p>Moving forward with this project I intend to create a fully functional admin panel to update, add, and delete
          recipes from the database. This would give me the foundations to create custom content management systems
          should I ever have the need to do so in the future.</p>
